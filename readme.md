## OCRReading_HALCON
Example for OCR reading within AppSpace using the HALCON API.
### Description
This App shows how to use a trained OCR handle to read characters in an image
using functionality implemented in HALCON. For running this sample a trained
OCR handle is necessary. If the sample OCRTraining_HALCON is run first, its
output in public AppData will be used. Otherwise there is a trained handle
provided as a resource with this App, which will be used instead. The result
of the reading will be shown in the standard 2D viewer.
### How to Run
The results can be seen in the 2D viewer on the web-page. Restarting the Sample may
be necessary to show images after loading the web-page.
To run this Sample a device with SICK Algorithm API, HALCON support and
AppEngine >= V2.5.0 is required. E.g. SIM4000 with latest firmware.
### Implementation
This sample is written using HALCON 12
